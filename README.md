Abstract:
In this project, we apply machine learning to predict solute drag in multicomponent alloys and determine which alloy categories are more stable. 
Since multiple factors influence solute drag, I will use a mathematical model to generate data for training. 
By analyzing trends and correlations, this study aims to predict alloy stability, providing valuable insights for designing alloys with tailored properties. 
The approach involves regression and neural networks, optimized for layer configuration and accuracy.


Data source: 
The data for this project were generated by a mathematical model proposed by the author and used in his PhD project as well. A file will be attached.


Method:
The methods used in this project are Linear Regression, Quadratic Regression, and Neural Network
